This repository contains our group’s analysis of three Pittsburgh neighborhood datasets (parks, police incidents, and 311 complaints) to determine which neighborhood offers the best overall quality of life.

To run the code in the notebooks, the some of the datasets must be downloaded and renamed to the corresponding filename found in the notebook, as they are too large to upload to GitHub.
